You will need

python https://www.python.org/downloads/

PyQt5 https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/


- download https://www.python.org/downloads/
- using cmd/powershell run `py -m pip install PyQt5`
- double click p99_race_timer.pyw (You can also run python3 p99_race_timer.pyw from cmd/powershell to get console output to troubleshoot if it isn't working)
- select file you want to watch
- for linux beep install sox `sudo apt install sox #deb`

I also packaged the script with pyinstaller. This bundles all the libraries, python, etc into a directory. If you don't want to manually install python and pyqt5 you can download the zip file located here: https://github.com/coninoftrol/p99_race_timer/releases/tag/v1.0.1

Once you download the zip file, extract it somewhere, and run `p99_race_timer`.
